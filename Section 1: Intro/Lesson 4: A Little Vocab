So, let's get the easiest on out of the way.

Instance:
You know those things in the explorer? Yeah. They're all instances. Workspace, ReplciatedStorage, the Camera in Workspace, yeah.
Those are all Instances.

Ok next, some complicated ones.

Child:
Do you see inside of Workspace, theres a camera? That's a child of Workspace. Place a part inside of Workspace? Boom. That is
now a Child of Workspace. Insert a Part in a Part? Well still, now the Part is the Child of the Part you placed it in.

Parent:
Basically what something is contained in. Place a part in Workspace? Workspace is the parent of that part.
