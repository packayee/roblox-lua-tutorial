Ok, so now, we can start actually scripting. Let's talk about the types of scripts. This is extremely important because they are
very useful. First, we have a Server Script, or Script. This is for Scripts that run on the Server. Remember, Filtering Enabled
exists. So these are very useful at times. Next is the Local Script. This is for Scripts that only run on a client. Every single
client. It has everything a Server Script has, but you might want to know who exactly the script is running on. That's where
Local Player comes in. More details later on in the series about that. For this first part of scripting we will only need
Server Scripts.
