Variables are used to store something, like a string, number, or instance (more on that later in the series). There are 2 types
of variables. Global variable, and local variable. Global variables can be acssesed throughout the whole script, and local var-
iables are used for code blocks. But, global variables kinds suck. So use local variables. (lol) Let's start scripting. In the
explorer, hover your mouse over a tab that says ServerScriptService (everything in the explorer will be explained throughout the
series). ServerScriptService is used for running Server Scripts. Putting a Local script inside of ServerScriptService will cause
an error. Now, go to the plus button next to ServerScriptService. Scroll down and find Script. Then insert it. Once you have a 
script in ServerScriptService, double click on the script. This is where you will put all of your code. Delete the
print("Hello World") at the top. Now, let's create a variable. In order to create a variable, put local:

local

then put the variable name:

local …variable name…

then do =:

local …variable name… =

then put what you want in the variable.

local …variable name… = …variable content…

Example:

local Waffles = "Waffles!"

Variables are useful for organizing and making code shorter. Keep in mind, never use variables for running code. If you really
want to use global variables, just do the same process as making a local variable, but delete the local.
